- Reddit post where someone said they were N thousand years old today
- It's fascinating, we don't think about modulations very often, but they are everywhere. They are also gaps in protocols. I found a birthday card that said "you are N days old" but this is not always accurate. The _severity / seriousness_ of the calculation is what makes it important.
- It only works if you know the birth year. People are also fascinated with hours, minutes etc - but this is less accessible information. What does it mean to be born?
- I like to layer in whimsy.
- Swatch beat time, alternative calendars etc.

Is the core idea here:
- To do something kind? (yes!)
- Whimsy? (yes?)
- To celebrate someone who doesn't like to celebrate themselves that much? There's something nice about extremely low-pressure celebrations. It's clearly a joke and as such it's close to zero risk / awkwardness.
- You can explain it clearly.

Why does "we all need more reasons to celebrate" resonate so much?

Interesting: the "gaps in protocols" permeates a lot of my work, a lot of the thing that I'm interested in.
This is also why I like the "dovenests" subreddit and "bone hurting juice"; it is a persistent violation of expectations.

THIS IS ONLY FOR THE LIVING

- Why not hours / minutes?

## Mourning a long-gone time online
- I liked the idea of free access to APIs; contact graphs etc etc.
- Back in 2010s I would've built this as something that connected to Facebook.
- That world is gone and I don't know if this is good or bad or not.

## Tech notes
Vite / Vitest -> amazing
JS dev -> good lord we need better tools here
