    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ This app runs entirely in your browser &mdash; none of your private information is sent anywhere. This includes your birthday, <em>and</em> any contacts which you may have imported from your Google Account or from file.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only accesses your contacts <em>names</em> and <em>birthday</em> &mdash; no other information is used or stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this app <em>does</em> cache both your birthday and contacts in your browser's local storage, if you ask it to. This means that other people who use the same browser on the same computer might be able to see your data.
      You can erase it by clicking the button here:
    </p>
    <p><button onclick="localStorage.clear()">Clear all saved data!</button>
    </p>
