    <h1>Data Usage and Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      ðŸ‘‹ This app runs entirely in your browser &mdash; none of your private information is sent anywhere. This includes your birthday, <em>and</em> any contacts which you may have imported from your Google Account or from file.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only accesses your contacts' <em>names</em> and <em>birthdays</em> &mdash; no other information is used or stored. It uses this information only for the purposes of computing 'days old' milestones.
    </p>
    <h2>Specifically about your Google user data</h2>
    <p>If you grant access, this application loads contact information from your Google account. Only the name and birthday of these contacts are used, and they're only used for calculating and displaying upcoming milestones related to the number of days since those birthdays. All calculations are performed in-browser; no information about your contacts is transmitted anywhere (including other apps / websites).</p>
    <p>This app's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
