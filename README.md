we all need more reasons to celebrate.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev # | build | preview | test
```

## Things for a v1 (ordered)
- Handle super old or super young birthdays in small app (just say something cute about "you're clearly a time-traveler, or you've made a typo")
- Include instructions for importing (make a video with sesame street characters)

## Out of scope:
- Edit imported data?
- cache data using IndexedDB.
- Add confetti animation IF it's your anniversary today
